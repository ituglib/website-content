<h1>Instructions for use of curl versions 7.70.0 and above</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf curl-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C /usr/local -p --no-same-user</code><br/>
to install curl. Make sure to have the directory containing the OpenSSL 1.0.2
version of libcrypt.so in your _RLD_LIB_PATH variable when curl is used.</p>
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run curl
version 7.70.1, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>

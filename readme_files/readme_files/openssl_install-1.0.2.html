<h1>Instructions for use of OpenSSL 1.0.2</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf openssl-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C / -p --no-same-user</code><br/>
to install OpenSSL. You must install the package in the exact same location as
in the tar file. Add the <code>/usr/local/lib</code> to your _RLD_LIB_PATH variable when
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is needed. Other versions of OpenSSL should be installed
elsewhere.</p>
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run git
version 1.0.2u, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>
</tr>
  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>J06.22</td>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X</td>
  <td>L19.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V</td>
  <td>L19.08</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>Note:</b> The OpenSSL team has deprecated version 1.0.2u as of December
2019. Security patches are no longer being created for that version.</p>

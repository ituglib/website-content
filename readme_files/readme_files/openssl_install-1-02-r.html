<h1>Instructions for use of OpenSSL versions 1.0.2q, 1.0.2r and 1.0.2s</h1><br/><br/>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run OpenSSL versions 1.0.2q, 1.0.2r  or 1.0.2s:<br/><br/>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>

  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td><b>Min RVU For 1.0.2r</b></td>

If you require new features or bug fixes that were released after 1.0.2o, you will have to download the source package and build the new version yourself.  This requires experience with FLOSS and with building open source tools on OSS. <br/><br/>
If you don't need these new features you should continue to use version 1.0.2o instead of the latest versions.

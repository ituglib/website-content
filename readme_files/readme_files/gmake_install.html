<h1>Instructions for use of GMAKE 4.1g and above:</h1>

<p>Upload the <code>gmake-<i>package</i>.pak.bin</code> file to GUARDIAN in
binary. The file can be named anything in GUARDIAN, typically
<code>gmakepak</code>.</p>

<p>Change the file code of the binary file to 1729 as follows:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>FUP ALTER gmakepak,CODE 1729</code></p>

<p>Run the UNPAK utility to install the GMAKE object in your desired
location:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>UNPAK gmakepak,*.*.*,listall,myid,vol $myvol.subvol,tapedate</code></p>

<p>Secure the GMAKE object based on your system's needs:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>FUP SECURE gmake,"NCNC"</p>

<p>The files in the PAK archive default to being owned by SUPER.SUPER and
secured "NUNU".</p>

<p>
Due to new features added in the latest Native Libraries, binaries built
with those may not function correctly on older RVUs. The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run gmake
version 4.1g, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>
</tr>
  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>J06.22</td>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X</td>
  <td>L19.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V</td>
  <td>L19.08</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If you require new features or bug fixes and your system is older than the
above RVUs, you may have to download the source package from GitHub and build the new version
yourself.  This requires experience with building open source tools on OSS.</p>

<p>The source repository for GMake currently resides at: <a href="https://github.com/ituglib/gmake">https://github.com/ituglib/gmake</a>. If you find any
issues, want new features, and wish to contribute, you can do so using
the GitHub site.</p>
